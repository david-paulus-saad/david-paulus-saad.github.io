Securely managing secrets is a critical aspect of modern software development. One common approach is to store secrets in Git to ensure versioning and easy rollback. However, storing secrets in plaintext in Git is not secure, as anyone with access to the repository can read them. To address this issue, we can use a tool called SOPS.

SOPS is an open-source tool that allows us to encrypt secrets and store them in Git. In this post, we'll discuss how to use SOPS to securely manage secrets in Git.

## Why Use SOPS?

We can use SOPS to encrypt secrets and store them in Git, while still allowing us to easily edit and manage them. SOPS supports several encryption providers, including AWS KMS, GCP KMS, PGP, and age. SOPS also supports many formats like YAML and JSON, which can be easily read by any service.

## How to Use SOPS

To use SOPS, we first need to create different encryption keys for each environment, such as dev and prod. We can do this using a key management service like AWS KMS, which provides role-based access and high availability.

Once we have our encryption keys, we can use SOPS to encrypt our secrets. SOPS supports many formats like YAML and JSON, which can be easily read by any service. Here's an example `.sops.yml` file for encrypting a YAML file:

```
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: .*/secrets/.*
    kms: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd5678
```

This `.sops.yml` file tells SOPS to encrypt any file under the `secrets` directory using the AWS KMS key with the specified ARN.

To encrypt a file using SOPS, we can run:

```
sops secrets.yaml
```

This will open the file in our default editor, where we can edit the plaintext version of the file. Once we save and close the editor, SOPS will encrypt the file using the specified encryption key.

To decrypt a file, we can run:

```
sops -d secrets.yaml
```

This will output the decrypted version of the file to the console.

## Integrating SOPS with Skaffold and Helm

We can integrate SOPS with Skaffold and Helm to automatically encrypt our secrets during the deployment process. To do this, we need to install the Helm Secrets plugin and add the `useHelmSecrets` option to our Skaffold configuration.

To install the Helm Secrets plugin, we can run:

```
helm plugin install https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets
```

Once we have installed the Helm Secrets plugin, we can update our Skaffold configuration to use the `useHelmSecrets` option:

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta15
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: my-app
build:
  artifacts:
    - image: my-app
      context: .
      docker:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
deploy:
  helm:
    releases:
      - name: my-app
        chartPath: helm/my-app
        valuesFiles:
          - helm/my-app/values.yaml
        useHelmSecrets: true
    
```


We can then update our `values.yaml` file to include the encrypted version of our secrets using SOPS:

Skaffold will automatically decrypt secrets using the Helm Secrets plugin during deployment, and it will handle the deletion of the decrypted files.

## MAC Mismatch and Security Features

One of the key security features of SOPS is that it uses a message authentication code (MAC) to ensure that the secrets haven't been tampered with. The MAC is generated using a SHA-256 hash of the plaintext secrets and is stored alongside the encrypted secrets in the YAML file.

If the MAC doesn't match the decrypted plaintext secrets, SOPS will detect the mismatch and throw an error. This is a crucial security feature because it prevents attackers from modifying the encrypted secrets without being detected.

## Conclusion

SOPS is a powerful tool for securely managing secrets in Git. By encrypting our secrets using SOPS and integrating it with our deployment process, we can ensure that our secrets are secure and easy to manage.
