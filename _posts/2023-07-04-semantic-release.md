Semantic-release is a powerful tool for managing releases in a software project. In this post, we'll explore how to use semantic-release to enforce semantic commits, automate release and publishing, share releases with your team, track issues using monitoring tools, and handle releases in a monorepo.

## Enforcing Semantic Commits

Semantic commits are a best practice for keeping your commit history organized and making it easier to track changes over time. By using tools like commitizen, commitlint, and husky hooks, you can enforce semantic commits in your project. For example, you might use commitizen to prompt developers to choose a type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, etc.) and a scope (e.g., module name) for each commit. Commitlint can then be used to validate that the commit message follows a specific format, such as the Conventional Commits specification.

## Automated Release and Publishing

Semantic-release can automate the process of releasing and publishing new versions of your software. By analyzing your commit history, semantic-release can determine the appropriate version number for each release based on the types of changes that have been made. It can then publish the release to both npm and GitHub Packages, ensuring that your users have access to the latest version of your software.

## Sharing Releases with Your Team

Once you've released a new version of your software, it's important to share it with your team. You can use Slack to notify your team of new releases and set up a subscription to your repository's new releases. This ensures that everyone on your team is aware of the latest changes and can update their development environments accordingly.

## Monitoring and Issue Tracking

Monitoring tools like Sentry can help you track issues specific to each release. By adding the release version to your monitoring tools, you can easily identify issues that are associated with a specific release. This makes it easier to debug issues and ensure that your software is running smoothly.

## Handling Releases in a Monorepo

If you're working with a monorepo, you can use semantic-release-monorepo to handle releases for each service separately. This tool analyzes the commit history for each service and determines the appropriate version number for each release based on the types of changes that have been made. This ensures that you can release new versions of each service independently, without affecting the other services in your monorepo.

In conclusion, semantic-release is a powerful tool for managing releases in a software project. By enforcing semantic commits, automating release and publishing, sharing releases with your team, tracking issues using monitoring tools, and handling releases in a monorepo, you can streamline your release process and ensure that your software is always up-to-date.
